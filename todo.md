# TODO

Current
- B: tidy Cat/MadLibs code (note: adding a method for adding sentences in big/simple chunks would be nice.)

MARKOV
- Grab an initial Bayesian and cat corpus/corpora
- Test Markovbot
- Later: scraping bayesian/cat source material

MADLIBS
- Parts of speech, maybe with topia.termextract?
- Markov chains?

SOMETHING AI
- G: I'll think of something to add as a module or an improvement to existing

ETC
- Running externally
